## SQL-Projects

This repository serves as a portfolio of hands-on projects focused on database solutions, data engineering, and business intelligence with SQL. Each project is a self-contained case study, demonstrating the complete data workflow from relational database design to advanced reporting.

The first entry is the **Bike Store Relational DB** project, a comprehensive case study that transforms raw e-commerce data into a robust, high-quality database solution.
